# Code-Editor

I created this project using create-react-app so to run this app, first use the following commands:
1. npm install (To install require npm packages)
2. npm run dev (To run React app)


This project is an online code compiler that allows users to write, compile, and execute code in various programming languages. It uses the Judge0 API to fetch user code and display the output. The Monaco Editor is integrated for a rich code editing experience.
